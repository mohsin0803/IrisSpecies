Iris Flower Classification Project
This project demonstrates the use of various machine learning algorithms to classify the species of Iris flowers based on their physical features. The Iris dataset is used as a classification problem where the objective is to predict the species of the Iris flower given the measurements of the sepal and petal lengths and widths.

Dataset
The dataset contains 150 entries with 5 features:

Id: Unique identifier for each sample.
SepalLengthCm: Sepal length in centimeters.
SepalWidthCm: Sepal width in centimeters.
PetalLengthCm: Petal length in centimeters.
PetalWidthCm: Petal width in centimeters.
Species: The class label representing the species of the flower (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica).
The dataset is available in datasets/iris/Iris.csv.

Objective
The goal of this project is to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements using different machine learning algorithms. The following models are evaluated:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Technologies and Libraries Used
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: Numerical computations.
matplotlib: Data visualization.
seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms and utilities.

Code Walkthrough
Data Preprocessing:

The Iris dataset is loaded and explored.
The Species column is separated as the target variable Y, and the rest of the features are used as input X.
Data is split into training and testing sets (70% training, 30% testing).
Visualization:

Various visualizations are created using Seaborn to understand the relationships between features and the target species.
Scatter plots, boxplots, and pair plots are used to explore the data.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN models are trained on the data.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, score, and precision (macro-average) are calculated for each model.
A summary of model performance is displayed.
Results:

The models produce very high accuracy and precision (mostly 100%) due to the simplicity of the Iris dataset.
The results show that multiple classifiers perform well, but Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and KNN all achieve perfect accuracy.
Model Results
Model	Accuracy (%)	Score (%)	Precision (%)
Logistic Regression	100.0	100.0	100.0
Support Vector Machine	100.0	100.0	100.0
Decision Tree	97.78	97.78	98.15
Random Forest	100.0	100.0	100.0
K-Nearest Neighbors	97.78	97.78	97.78
Conclusion
In this project, various machine learning algorithms were implemented to classify the species of Iris flowers. While most models achieved very high accuracy and precision, the Logistic Regression and SVM models provided perfect predictions for this particular dataset. However, in real-world scenarios, further tuning and data preprocessing might be required for achieving optimal performance.
